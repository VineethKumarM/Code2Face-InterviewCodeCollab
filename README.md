# Code2Face-InterviewCodeCollab
A single application for face to face video interviews , also provides a realtime code editor which the participants can use to instruct, evaluate and collaborate with other participants. Very helpful for practicing mock interviews with your friends.

- Note : Currently users in the same network are able to connect, this is mostly due to the peerJS implementation I am using. I will try to update the functionality so that anyone from anywhere can connect to each other.
